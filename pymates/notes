global coordinate frame in the CAD file


"yellow globe" = "control point thingy"
exists at a particular xyz location in reference to the global coordinate frame
its local z direction is pointing this way "outwards" - how it must move in order to mate with the mating part
the x and y would be arbitrary off of this point.

there's another port on the back of this, say, its z is pointing backwards (it has to move in that basic direction)
if y is in the same direction, then x is now where the original z was

it's an extra unit vector  (the blue stuff / yellow orbes)


collision detection might be the wrong board
algorithms:
    - volume overlap algorithm
        - normalize this volume that you find (you find the interference volume)
        - the port specifies its volume (in the YAML file)
        - average the two port's volumes together and you should never be higher than that (or add them together)
        - "the interference volume"
    - collision detection
    - 


up inside this hole, there is a corresponding blue dot that will mate with it
this blue dot is pointing in the z axis in the opposite direction of the other part
y is into the board now (if you will)

when they properly mate, the z values are in opposite directions
the x values must line up
y values are forced to be in opposite directions

the z has to be in the direction of "free movement"

"alignment vector" or something

xyz
rotation asimuth  to put this z at that intersection
rotation from the global axis. 


4x4 coordinate transformation
tau x tau y tau z == how far you have to transfer the global to get to the point (the blue dot)
the bottom row of the matrix is meaningless (zero)
the other three columns are the original three unit vectors for this blue dot
the z axis is pointing in the positive y, so this would be z, this would be x, this would be y


i -1 0 0 tx
j 0 0 1 ty
k 0 1 0 tz
  0 0 0 1

tx = 50
ty = 50
tz = 0

i&x
j&y
k&z




translations
scewings
all sorts of other transformations

IGES over STEP
IGES volumetric & boundary yes/no? this determines what needs to exist in the port data (volumetric primitives & the operations that go)
IGES - add a point at a particular location? then tag it as a control point

ports in a yaml file

ports:
    port 1: 
        - 4x4 location
        #- list of faces (ID numbers)
        - feature tag ("square") generic geometry
        - allowed to be interfering?
        # - list of rigid faces (later) (versus compliance)
        # - list of flexible faces (later)
        # - eventually other stuff

HeeksCAD coordinate transformations - set of axises floating in space where-ever you want (ask fenn)

public double [0 1] compatibility (URI to artifact 1 CAD, URI to artifact 2 CAD)
    - this calls the second one
    - checks all possible combinations of ports by calling the other overload
    - return a giant matrix of the possibilities
public double [0 1] compatibility (URI to artifact 1 CAD, int p#, URI to artifact 2 CAD, int port number #2)
    - returns a single value
    - don't worry about rotation for starters
    




rotate and translate the CAD models so that the z's are opposite and the x's line up and so on (for two CAD parts that are being mated)


artifact 2:
[50]
[50]
[0]

artifact 1:
[100]
[10]
[10]

how much do you translate the second one to get to fifty?

move vector = artifact1.translation - artifact2.translation

B
0 0 1 100
-1 0 0 10
0 -1 0 10
0 0 0 1

we want that port to eventually be at:

A
-1 0 0 50
0 0 -1 50
0 -1 0 0
0 0 0 1

so it's just the same as the original 4x4 matrix except x is the same, and the directions on y and z are flipped



A = BT
find the matrix T

then apply this T to the whole part




AB^-1 = T
find the inverse of B
Kramer's rule? (see Wikipedia)
