Hello! You must be new to all this so here's a rough breakdown of what is going on.

overview: http://adl.serveftp.org/dokuwiki/skdb

Completed features:
- a simple example package describing a typical screw from the hardware store
  - the screw has a set of requirements for being manufactured
  - the package has a set of packages it needs to work right (threads package)
  - the package contains metadata such as homepage URL, author, copyright license
- run packages/lego/demo.py to demonstrate interface compatibility
- run paths.py to demonstrate making a lego assembly
- generate an assembly graph via igraph


here is a break down of the current directory structure:

clients/
    front-ends for ordering parts. later there will be tools here for doing pretend scenarios, generating instructions, or assembling armies of giant robots

core/
    code needed for loading, parsing, and drawing inferences from package data

geom/
    optional code to work with pythonOCC/OpenCASCADE

gui/
    optional code to work with pythonOCC/wxPython (graphical user interface)

dep/
    start of a general purpose dependency resolution engine, for figuring out what tools are necessary to make the tools to make the tools...

doc/
    instructions for how to use SKDB (maybe some day)

doc/BOMs
    miscellaneous "required materials" lists for different fields of study (half-baked)

doc/proposals
    pseudo-code used by the developers to bounce ideas off each other

icons/
    generic representations of manufacturing techniques. this will move soon

import_tools/
    command line scripts that are used to convert from external file formats and databases

inventory/
    (mostly web-based) tools for managing your personal inventory, searching for resources in other locations, and data about various specific facilities and their access policy

packages/
    sample SKDB packages defining a set of artifacts, processes and stuff you can do with them

tests/
    run these after hacking to make sure you didn't break anything
