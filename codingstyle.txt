the following will make ben happy:
lower case attributes, variables, function names
upper case classes
4-space indentation
short variable names that are english words
no unnecessary positional arguments, use named arguments

not loading yaml files and dumping the output and then editing it
pull before you commit, so as not to generate spurious merge commits
