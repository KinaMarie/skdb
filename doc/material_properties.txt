There are a variety of other properties to consider in an environmental impact assessment that effect the ecological or human environment that may be difficult to quantify (unlike most of the properties listed on this page) including pollution (extraction, transportation, manufacture), scarcity/abundance, habitat destruction, renewability, recycleability, wars fought over materials, labor exploitation, etc. These can be subjective, dependent on context, or inadequately measured.
