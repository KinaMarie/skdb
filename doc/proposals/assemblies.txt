re: pymates parts and assemblies
.. which will eventually be moved out of skdb/pymates/ and into the real
world.

A part is atomic in the system. Any two given parts can potentially be
connected ("mated") to one another with some amount of compatibility.

Not all parts are able to mate with all other parts. Mate success, or
compatibility, is dependent on shape, geometry, tolerances, and
interface specifications.

Any two given parts can potentially be connected ("mated") with another
part in a number of different ways. When two parts are mated, a mate
object is produced (pymates.Mate). A mate object explicitly defines
which combination of two given parts is implied.

Mate objects (pymates.Mate) can be mated with other mates.
Mate objects (pymates.Mate) can be mated with other parts.

A pipe that will be outputting 3kpsi should not be compatible with
a pipe rated for taking 15psi (unless explicitly forced).

An assembly is a collection of parts and particular mates between those
parts. An assembly can be split into parts. An assembly can be split
into mates.

?? An assembly can be represented as the Head or Root "Mate" object.
All other connecting mates to this "head" mate are said to be in the same
assembly. It's more like a graph. Parts can be involved in multiple mates
in the same system, so branches become cycles (or something) so it's not
merely a tree.

An assembly can be a part.
