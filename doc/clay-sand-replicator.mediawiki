= Chasis / framework / platform =
Let's say 10-by-10 feet or there-abouts. 2D platform. 

assuming solar power as the primary energy source, we will need more than that for the collector if we want to do sintering of large ceramic pieces or lots of electricity (solar steam or stirling)   
  
= Behavior =   
although one machine can do everything on its own, they will be more productive in groups, each adapting to run one single process in a continuous manner, trading products and refined materials. movement happens mainly to reduce population pressure and when resources become scarce.

= Problems =
how to make electricity without the use of permanent magnets or iron? electricity is needed for electrolysis (and communication/control)
*'''magnetohydrodynamics''' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHD_generator]
**sodium vapor plasma
*piezoelectricity
*ferroelectricity
*static electricity (pooh)
*'''amtec''' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali-metal_thermal_to_electric_converter]
*thermionic converter
*photoelectric effect
*zinc-air fuel cell
*field coil alternator (like in a car, requires a battery)


= Mechanical arm / manipulator =
actuators take a supply of power and turn it into controlled motion:   
*rotary actuators   
#electric motors   
##commutated field coil   
##switched reluctance (requires iron)   
##permanent magnets (requires other rare elements)   
##homopolar motor (extremely poor efficiency)   
##piezo ceramic motors [http://www.newscaletech.com/squiggle_overview.html]   
#compressed air motors   
#steam motors   
 
*linear actuators   
#piezo inchworm linear stepper[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchworm_motor]   
#hydraulic cylinders   
#pneumatic cylinders   
#air muscles   
#fluid muscles
