    * read STEP ISO 10303
        * figure out how to add a feature to the file (instead of using pymates/models/blockhole.yaml)
        # well that was a dead end. Solidworks, AutoCAD, and even PRO/E can't seem to do annotations with STEP ISO 10303 AP214.
    * use tags/names for geometories in pymates/models/blockhole.yaml
    * unit tests for part mating
    * more example parts: legos?
        * attempt to extract data from LeoCAD and ldraw
        * attempt to extract data from Regli's National Design Repository (lego VRML files)
    * shaft in a lego brick:
        * slop (a distance)
           * the minimum distance between those two surfaces
           * whereas intersection is the maximum distance between those two interfaces
        * play
        * sine distance function
            * circular peg in a square hole
            * zero: perfect fit
            * positive: a little bit of slop
            * negative: interference fit
            * distances between two surfaces in OpenCASCADE
                * in which case you need faces
         * Constructive Solid Geometry
            * any volume leftover?
         * put the block into a bigger block and get the "mold"
            * amount of space remaining
            * do the subtraction again and get the space remaining - to get the slop
         * distances between faces v. solid geometry approach
