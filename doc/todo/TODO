skdb core:
    geom:
        connection graph:
            apply transforms at each arc while traversing:
            wrap some graph class instead of using directly for easy swapping:

            method of computing roll (rotation around the normal vector)
            start with origin. rotate both Z and X in global el and az so that Z lines
            up with z_vec. now roll is the angle between twice rotated X and final x_vec
