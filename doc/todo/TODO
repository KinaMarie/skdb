documentation:
    everybody loves documentation!
skdb core:
    units:
        peak and continuous ratings: what are default time constants?
        yaml path resolver: for max/min/peak/continuous/power/torque/height/width etc
        yaml regex resolver: how to do this without matching over entire units .dat?
    statistics:
        arbitrary distributions: processes often follow odd laws (non-gaussian)
        evaluate typical feasible: but dont dump some messy construct
        think about how to utilize statistical data: in search/optimization algorithms
    geom:
        wrap TopoDS_Shape in Shape class:
            fix __eq__ error in yaml dump:
            make assembly graph yaml dump work:
        get rid of STEP loading spam:
            and other OCC spam:
        real wrapper code: instead of subclassing from OCC. openGL example
        connection graph:
            apply transforms at each arc while traversing: is this done?
            wrap some graph class instead of using directly for easy swapping:
        part mating:
            collision detection: and percentage interference allowed
        cam algorithm selection: some parts are more 2.5d than others...
inventory:
    container tags: ['!ziploc', '!fishtub', etc]
    location schema: any ideas? no dGPS or RFID please. '!shelf'?
package code:
    generate instructions for making a package: lego explohzionn
    technology readiness level:
    metadata resolution description: [stub, incomplete, usable, finished, obsessive]
clients: #desktop, unless you really like writing javascript?

        description: "it's like apt-get/dpkg except for hardware and real stuff"

        note: write unit tests first to verify dependencies are satisfied
