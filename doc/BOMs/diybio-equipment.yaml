description:
    This document lists out basic lab equipment, supplies, materials and
    reagents that would make up an ideal molecular biology lab. At the same
    time, this document exists to help list equipment that is useful in
    do-it-yourself biology projects. Hypothetically, hardware packages will be
    made for each of these.

notes:
    glassware: the name is deceptive because it is more than just glass..
    sizes: these are just common sizes, not super important
