how to make a civilization seed (20min)

what is a "civilization seed"
    broad overview
    why it is useful, what is possible, what isn't possible
        can't copy all of civilization as it is right now, so that one's out
    rest of talk is where we've been and how to get to where we want to go
open source
    what is open source software and open source hardware?
    GNU, FSF
    ideal: redundancy, growth, longtails, distributed development, FSF software freedoms
    oh look, debian has done this
debian
    big fancy numbers about estimated value of debian
    growth of number of packages - why did "dpkg" happen, etc.
    debian is like "self-replication"
    dpkg / apt-get
    package maintainers
    number of maintainers
similiar to the growing pains of the debian community before dpkg we have:
    hackerspaces, fablabs, men sheds, tech shops
    diybio
    instructables
    thingiverse
    make magazine
    diy h+
    open source medicine
    pink army
    synthetic biology
    harkopen
    many many amateur hardware communities, thousands of modders
    ..
skdb "apt-get hardware"
    downloading hardware over the web
skdb demos: legos, screws, threads
package maintainers
    who should you bug? ben, bryan, heath
open source hardware / transhuman co-operative (of package maintainers)
theme goal of the co-op: self-replication, freitas, kinematic self-replicating machines, AASM
